Dont ask.

Anyways, If you somehow find out you need to track the amount of eggs you eat along with 
a friend you need a `users.json` file at the top level, such as:

```JSON
{
    "users": [
        {
            "name": "blah",
            "code": "blahblah1234"
        },
        // ...
    ]
}
```
